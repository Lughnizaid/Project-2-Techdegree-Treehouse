          <h2>Journey to Germany</h2>
          <img src="images/germany.jpg" alt="Germany University" class="peta">
          <p>While travelling in Australia, I realized that I has a dream that I haven't realized, and that is studying in Germany. It is so funny that I remembered this dream while I am still in Australia.</p>
          <p>However, it is a very interesting time, that I remembered this childhood dream while I am in the middle of the great Canyon, seeing the night stars. In that night I realized that what if I am dying and have only months to live. What I want to do in Life, What I will regret that I did not.</p>
          <p>Why di I want to study in Germany? It is because of the education system in Germany is really good. KSMost of the German universities are public institutions, and students traditionally study without fee payment.The general requirement for university is the Abitur. However, there are a number of exceptions, depending on the state, the college and the subject. Tuition free academic education is open to international students and is increasingly common. According to an OECD report in 2014, Germany is the world's third leading destination for international study. </p>
          <p>Germany has a long tradition of higher education. The established universities in Germany include some of the oldest in the world, with Heidelberg University (established in 1386) being the oldest. It is followed by the Leipzig University (1409), the Rostock University (1419) and the Greifswald University (1456).The University of Berlin, founded in 1810 by the liberal educational reformer Wilhelm von Humboldt, became the academic model for many European and Western universities. In the contemporary era Germany has developed eleven Universities of Excellence: Humboldt University of Berlin, the University of Bremen, the University of Cologne, TU Dresden, the University of TÃ¼bingen, RWTH Aachen, FU Berlin, Heidelberg University, the University of Konstanz, LMU Munich, and the Technical University of Munich. </p>
