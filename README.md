<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>For this project, I practiced my web design skills by editing HTML elements and their styles. With the HTML and CSS already provided, I was asked to add, edit, and remove the pre-existing code and make it my own.</p> 
<br>
<p>Part of the project was to also add additional pages and images on your own for meeting the exceeds criteria. This gave me a good first look on working with HTML and CSS.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>At the end of this project, I had a better understanding of HTML and CSS. This project gave me a web page that I can use as a personal online portfolio to advertise my experience, skills, and goals. It could also be used to share my social media links!</p>.
